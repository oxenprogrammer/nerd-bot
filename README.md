# Capstone Project: Ruby: Slack Bot
> nerd-bot is a bot built with the goal to automate jokes and humor mainly popular within the developers community. Most times
we developers/programmers get tired writing code and since https://www.slack.com is where most of our interaction occurs, it's not uncommon to just chat with a bot cracking jokes as your teammates might still be busy, nice right?
Nerd-bot scraps the web and returns you random jokes in form of images or text given the right commands in slack.

  ### Ruby Project
  - Clone this project locally

  - Run `bundle exec rackup` to start it the server
  - Your bot should be working by now

  ### Running Test
  - Test have been built using `Rspec` as Test Runner and Fixture
  - Test Coverage by `SimpleCov`
  - Run `rspec` to run the test
  - On windows run `open coverage/index.html` for code coverage
  - On unix based systems run `xdg-open coverage/index.html` for code coverage

  ### Testing on Slack
  - The bot can be invited into other workspace or direct messaged
  - Use `@bot_username jokes_image` to get programming jokes as images where `@bot_username` is the name of your bot
  - Use `@bot_username jokes_text` to get programming jokes as texts
  - Use `@bot_username say_hello` to greet the bot
